        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>DESIGNATED SPONSOR (DS) ASSIGNED</strong><br/><em style="color:#D00000;">No action is necessary on your part.</em><br/><em style="color:#D00000;">Please review for your understanding.</em></p>
        <p>Hello First Name / Last Name,</p>
        <p>This notice is to affirm that your registration with VIRON.NETWORK is now complete, and the status of your <strong>VIRON Home-Business (&ldquo;VHB&rdquo;)</strong> is PAID.</p>
        <p>Further, your account with the qualified third-party MLM company: <strong>SAVE CLUB</strong> (&ldquo;<strong>SC</strong>&rdquo;), has been established, and your position with SC is <u>correctly</u> placed under the VIRON umbrella.&nbsp;</p>
        <p></p>
        <p><em style="color:#D00000;">*<strong>NOTE 1: </strong></em><em style="color:#0000B3;">Unless otherwise noted, for your convenience, your VIRON account profile, such as your <strong>username</strong>, <strong>password</strong>, and <strong>email</strong>, etc., <strong><u>is the same as your SC account profile</u>. </strong></em></p>
        <p><em style="color:#D00000;">*<strong>NOTE 2: </strong></em><em style="color:#0000B3;">You will receive Email messages and newsletters from SC&rsquo;s normal notifications. But as you may already be aware, you do not have to respond to any of them unless they pertain to actions required to maintain your SC account, or if they are actions you have triggered yourself. </em></p>
        <p></p>
        <p><em style="color:#D00000;">*<strong>NOTE 3: </strong><strong></em><em style="color:#0000B3;">For your additional convenience, on your behalf, the VIRON company monitors SC&rsquo;s notifications. If there is anything urgent or important that we feel you should be aware of, we will notify you accordingly via VIRON notifications.</strong> </em><span style="color:#D00000;">Please be aware that SC has sent you notices regarding your new account that VIRON has set up for you. You can access your SC account by logging in with the SC link accordingly (located within their &ldquo;Welcome Email&rdquo;).</span></p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">SYSTEM REMINDER 1:</h3>
        <p>VIRON is 100% Turn-Key and fully automated. Everything will be handled professionally and automatically for you.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">SYSTEM REMINDER 2:</h3>
        <p>VIRON systems level the playing field for every individual. *This means that every<strong> Direct Referral (DR)</strong> generated by VIRON will be placed and assigned to members like you.</p>
        <p style="color:#D00000; text-align: center;"><strong><u>Always use your VIRON Referral Link.</u></strong></p>
        <p>IMPORTANT: If you use your SC Referral Link to refer others, VIRON will not be aware of your DR, and your referrals will not have access to VIRON services. As a result, VIRON will not be able to build their SC downline the way we are building yours (keep in mind that your DR&rsquo;s downline is a part of your downline too). Therefore, <strong style="color:#D00000;"><u>always use your VIRON Referral Link.</u></strong> NOTE: When you refer anyone using your VIRON Referral Link, those DRs will automatically be placed under you within SC as well.</p>

        <p style="color:#0000B3;">This is to notify you that you are now officially assigned to your VIRON:<br/><strong>DESIGNATED SPONSOR (&ldquo;DS&rdquo;).</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Your <span style="color:#0000B3;">DSâ€™s</span> profile:</strong><br /></p>
        <p><strong>First Name: ________________</strong><br/><strong>Last Name: ________________</strong><br/><strong>Email: ________________</strong></br><strong>VIRON Username: ________________</strong></p>
        <p style="color:#D00000;"><strong>Your account is now placed <u>correctly</u> within your DS downline.</strong></p>
        <p style="color:#0000B3;"><strong>Your DS is also notified of your account placement.</strong></p>
        <p>Since VIRON handles everything for you professionally, you do not need to contact your DS. However, please note that your DS is typically more aware of VIRON details because they have been involved with VIRON longer than you have. So, your DS can be considered your friend for additional support, and you can <u>optionally</u> contact them for that purpose. The choice is up to you.</p>
