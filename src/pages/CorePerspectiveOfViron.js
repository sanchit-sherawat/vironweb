            <p class="pb-20">The exact phrase <em>&ldquo;people fail, systems prevail&rdquo;</em> may not have a single known origin but is a <strong>modern distillation of ideas from systems theory and quality management</strong>. It&rsquo;s often used in management, healthcare, aviation, and software development to <strong>advocate for building resilient systems</strong> that minimize human error.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p className='text-center'><strong>Vinh H. Le&rsquo;s analysis, comments, and real-world application:</strong></p>
            <p class="pb-20">Per the history side of things, in my opinion, the phrase or idea of: <strong><em>&ldquo;People Fail, Systems Prevail&rdquo;</em></strong> - logically or most likely stemmed from:</p>
            <p class="pb-20"><strong>W. Edwards Deming</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mr.Deming, a pioneer in quality management and systems thinking, emphasized <u>process rather than assigning blame to individuals.</u> His most notable work was in transforming Japanese manufacturing after World War II. Mr. Deming often emphasized: <strong className='text-blue'><em>&ldquo;A bad system will beat a good person every time.&rdquo; </em></strong>This conveys a similar concept: <u>system design has a greater impact on outcomes than individual effort or competence</u>.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr/>
            <p class="pb-20">I took the liberty of understanding that most people that have failed, are failing, or will fail in MLM because they <u>cannot sell</u>. But of course, for a <em>&ldquo;cha-ching&rdquo;</em> (a sale) to occur, someone has to buy something, and someone has to SELL something. Therefore, we cannot <em>remove</em> the &ldquo;selling&rdquo; aspect from the equation.</p>
            <p className='text-tab'>I simply <em>&ldquo;<strong><u>transferred</u></strong>&rdquo;</em> the <em>Selling</em> element <u>from the individuals (amateurs)&hellip;to the <strong>PROFESSIONALS</strong></u>. Thus, the VIRON concept per: <em className='text-red'>&ldquo;Let Professionals Build Your Network Marketing Business <strong><u>for</u></strong> You&rdquo;.</em> </p>
            <p className='text-tab2'>Then I &ldquo;super-systemized&rdquo; it.</p>
            <p className='text-tab3'>The result, VIRON.NETWORK</p>
            <p className='text-tab4'>Imminent deployment 2025.</p>
