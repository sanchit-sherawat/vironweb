            <p class="pb-20"><strong className='text-blue'>With VIRON, you do not need to attend Meetings, Webinars, nor respond to any third-party MLM Company&rsquo;s "Newsletters". You do not need to contact your Upline (other than to say &ldquo;hi&rdquo;, and you definitely do not need any "training"!</strong><strong> </strong><strong><u>With VIRON&hellip;ALL of that is now irrelevant</u></strong>! *This positive situation is even beneficial for the MLM Company itself, as VIRON handles all the hard work for you to build your MLM downline automatically. <strong><u>Effectively eliminating all the traditional stresses</u></strong>.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p class="pb-20">Especially in today&rsquo;s economy, the <strong className='text-red'><u>VIRON Home-Business</u></strong> (&ldquo;<strong className='text-red'><u>VHB</u></strong>&rdquo;) is of utmost value because, whether an individual knows VIRON exists or not, they need or want the VHB, <strong><u>right now</u></strong>, worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="pb-20">*When you directly compare the VHB to the typical business &ldquo;<em>franchise</em>&rdquo; (such as a McDonald&rsquo;s franchise)&hellip;the VHB is arguably <u>superior</u>, because:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Logically, being the most powerful solution, further &ldquo;super-systemized&rdquo; for the network marketing industry, the <strong className='text-blue'><em><u>probability</u></em></strong> of the VHB entering you into a profitable situation in a relatively short time is far higher than any other business (offline or online).</li>
              <li>When you couple the above with VIRON&rsquo;s <strong className='text-blue'><em><u>affordability</u></em></strong> factor (<strong>the</strong> <strong><u>current market</u> price of a VHB is only $499 total for the total home-business system</strong>), it makes the VHB really the only choice for anyone (whether you are poor or wealthy).</li>
              <li>Sure, if you are wealthy, you would want multiple VHBs, which is normal. <strong>*But if you are poor or not yet financially free, you really need a VHB! </strong><strong className='text-red'><u>AND CAN AFFORD IT! </u></strong></li>
              <li><u className='text-blue'>VIRON is naturally civic because it can level the playing field for any individual who wants a VHB</u>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pb-20"></p>
            <p className='text-red'><strong><em>Here is a good analogy for understanding VIRON&hellip;</em></strong></p>
            <p className='text-tab'><strong><em>In the world of Network Marketing, you are expected to go into countless sales &ldquo;battles&rdquo; and do the fighting alone.
