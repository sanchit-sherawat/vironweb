              <p>VIRON.NETWORK, aka: "<strong className='text-red'>VIRON</strong>", has non-arbitrarily <em>qualified</em> the third-party MLM Company to be marketed by <strong>VIRON</strong>. It is essential that you understand the VIRON Qualification Parameters apply to any MLM Company that VIRON will build <em><u>for</u></em> you.</p>
              <p>NOTE: The third-party MLM company is also known as the &ldquo;<em>VEHICLE</em>&rdquo;. The information and details are published in your VIRON Back-Office / Members area.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>First, the MLM Company&rsquo;s leadership must be <u>ethical</u>. Its compensation plan must be rewarding and <u>civic</u>. <strong><em>*This overall perspective is vital to VIRON&rsquo;s presence and global objective. </em></strong><em>In other words, VIRON represents you; it would be no good if the MLM company makes us &ldquo;look bad&rdquo;.<strong> </strong></em></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Further, the MLM Company&rsquo;s product(s) must be <u>affordable</u>. And they must have <u>strong financial backing and a solid management team</u> for long-term and stable growth. They must have a sound plan to <u>outperform their nearest competitors</u> in their market.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <p>We strongly look for overall <strong><em><u>SYNERGY</u></em></strong>. Meaning, the MLM Company must be useful value to you and/or able to help you increase your bottom line and/or be a positive element in your Life.</p>
            <p className='mb-0'><strong>AVAILABILITY:</strong></p>
            <p className='mt-0'>Since inception, VIRON&rsquo;s <strong className='text-red'><em>&ldquo;Let Professionals Build Your Network Marketing Business <u>for</u> You&rdquo;</em></strong> has been substantiated to be of the HIGHEST in DEMAND concept and is of the LOWEST in conversion &ldquo;<em>Resistance</em>&rdquo;. VIRON is <u>internationally ready</u> and literally <u>available</u> ANYWHERE there is an &ldquo;<em>internet connection</em>&rdquo;. Hence, VIRON requires the MLM Company to be international-ready as well (so VIRON systems are <u>able</u> to deliver access and success to its Members worldwide). </p>
            <p>Example: if VIRON markets an MLM Company that is NOT available in your Country or the &ldquo;<em>product</em>&rdquo; cannot be <em>delivered</em> to you - it makes VIRON &ldquo;<em>unavailable</em>&rdquo; to you as well, and VIRON would not be able to do anything for you in terms of building you the income from that MLM Company.</p>
            <p>So, we found and concluded that MLM Companies with &ldquo;<em>tangible</em>&rdquo; type of products naturally inherit &ldquo;<em>delivery</em>&rdquo; or <em>availability</em> problems for our Members. Hence, to ensure that we can touch your life wherever you may be, VIRON will only qualify &ldquo;<em><u>intangible</u></em>&rdquo; type of products that can be delivered internationally (i.e. Software, Digital, Travel Clubs, Savings Clubs, Education/Knowledge, Online Service, etc.).&nbsp;</p>
            <p className='mb-0'><strong>COMPATIBILITY:</strong></p>
            <p className='mt-0'>Importantly, the MLM company&rsquo;s CEO and its Administration would need to have a direct corporate relationship with VIRON to accommodate the ongoing <span className='text-red'><em><u>Reassignment</u></em> of VIRON-sponsored or <strong>Direct Referrals</strong> (&ldquo;<strong>DRs</strong>&rdquo;)</span> <u>to be placed into your Downline</u>.</p>
            <p className='mb-0'><strong>COMPENSATION PLAN:</strong></p>
            <p className='mt-0'>The MLM company&rsquo;s compensation plan must have a high <strong><em><u>achievability</u></em></strong> factor. Statistic shows that the average person in MLM can only &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo; or &ldquo;Recruit&rdquo; 2 (two) people or less. <span className='text-red'>Although <strong>VIRON</strong> will professionally build your Downline for you and will be doing all the hard work, the easier it is to achieve a certain income level, of course, the better it is for everyone involved.</span> Further, the Compensation Plan is preferred to be a <em><u>Vertical or &ldquo;Straight Line&rdquo; (SL) Matrix</u></em> as well and not &ldquo;binary&rdquo; or structured un-civically. A vertical matrix naturally inherits the most &ldquo;<em>Spill</em>&rdquo; over factor, which helps people and is = More Civic. <em>*So, a SL Matrix is best, and a &ldquo;forced&rdquo; matrix would be the next best thing. </em></p>
            <p><strong>Because VIRON Members only deserve the best, if the MLM Company does not meet the above requirements, it cannot be qualified.</strong></p>
            <hr/>
            <p className='mb-0'><strong>SUSTAINABILITY:</strong></p>
            <p className='mt-0'>To ensure sustainability, VIRON requires that an Individual can enjoy and benefit from just using the Product of the MLM Company alone (<em>at a fair price</em>) - WITHOUT any &ldquo;<em>Referring</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Recruiting</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Sponsoring</em>&rdquo;.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &ldquo;Referring&rdquo; is only suggested [if] one wishes to earn more money based on the foundation stated above. <em>*Much like being able to earn a commission for referring someone to a great restaurant. </em></p>
            <p></p>
            <p className='mb-0'><strong>Last, but not least.</strong></p>
            <p className='mt-0'>For those of you who have asked or are concerned about: <strong><em>&ldquo;WHAT HAPPENS IF the MLM COMPANY THAT VIRON IS MARKETING GOES OUT OF BUSINESS OR becomes insolvent or is SHUT DOWN BY THE GOVERNMENT&rdquo;?</em></strong> </p>
            <p>The answer to that is simple:</p>
            <p>We have designed the VIRON organization to provide protection and maintain an advantage. Meaning, as you engage with VIRON and are Registered (Time &amp; Date Stamped), you are &ldquo;<em>Set for Life</em>&rdquo;. Because this very data is securely transmitted to the MLM Company at the time we engage with them. They will securely use that data to position you <u>correctly</u> and all VIRON Members accordingly. In the rare chance that the MLM</p>
            <p>Company &ldquo;goes out of business&rdquo;, it will NOT hurt you or any VIRON Member in any way because we can simply implement the BACK-UP MLM Company &ndash; immediately, by way of sending the same secured (Time &amp; Date Stamped) data to the new MLM Company that is replacing the existing entity, [if] they become insolvent.</p>
            <p>The only possible cost to you from that situation is to use a portion of your previous profits to pay for the new Registration/Engagement costs with the new company <span className='text-red'>(<em>to ensure an immediate </em><em><u>continuation</u> of your income with no significant disruptions</em>)</span>. This would be considered the &ldquo;worst-case scenario&rdquo; as opposed to <em>&ldquo;having to start all over&rdquo;</em> every time an MLM Company goes out of business or <em>&ldquo;goes bad&rdquo;</em>. This is a remarkable phenomenon when you are part of VIRON, as a unified organization.</p>
            <p><strong className='text-red'>Also remember, <u>VIRON is spending good money and energies marketing the MLM company, ongoing</u>. </strong>Thus, they need to maintain their license and compliance.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, as a Civic company with a Civic purpose, VIRON shall always have the upper hand, and we will not allow any third-party disruptions/corruption/ineptitude to jeopardize the future of any VIRON Member &ndash; period.</p>
            <p>As we unite and journey together as a ONE-UNIT (TEAM) and Company, your MLM <em>Salvation</em> AND natural <em><u>Defense</u></em> of yours and your Family&rsquo;s Dreams &amp; Reputation are all protected by VIRON.</p>
            <p><strong><em>-The VIRON Administration</em></strong></p>
